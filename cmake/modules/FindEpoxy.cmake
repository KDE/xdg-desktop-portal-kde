# FindEpoxy
# -------
#
# - Try to find libepoxy.
#
# This will define the following variables:
#
#  ``Epoxy_FOUND``
#     TRUE if libepoxy was found
#  ``Epoxy_LIBRARIES``
#     Pass this variable to target_link_libraries()
#  ``Epoxy_INCLUDE_DIRS``
#     This should be passed to target_include_directories() to use the
#     libepoxy headers
#  ``Epoxy_DEFINITIONS``
#     Can be passed to target_compile_options() if necessary
#
#  ``Epoxy_HAS_GLX``
#     Whether GLX support is available
